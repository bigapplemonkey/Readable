# Readable: A Book Tracking App

In this project, we leverage Redux's application state management capability and React's component modularity to create a content and comment responsive web app.

## Functionality

In Readable users are be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit, delete posts and comments and search posts.
